The gr-gsm project
==================
The *gr-gsm* project is based on the *gsm-receiver* written by Piotr Krysik (also the main author of *gr-gsm*) for the *Airprobe* project.

The aim is to provide set of tools for receiving information transmitted by GSM equipment/devices.

Installation
============
The project is based on *GNU Radio* signal processing framework and takes advantage of its great features like stream tagging and message passing.
Presence of *GNU Radio* is therefore a basic requirement for compilation and installation of *gr-gsm*. 

The easiest way to install *gr-gsm* it to use *pybombs* installer (GNU Radio install management system). Installation with this tool was tested on Ubuntu 14.04 and 14.10 (on 14.10 installation will be much faster as compilation of *GNU Radio* is not necessary).
For installation of pybombs you will need git. On Debian based distributions you can get it with:
```sh
sudo apt-get install git
```
Then download *pybombs* sources using git:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pybombs/pybombs.git
```

Go into *pybombs* directory and configure it:
```sh
cd pybombs
./pybombs config
```

As a install prefix enter */usr/local/*. The rest of the options can be left as defaul.

On distributions that have *GNU Radio* version 3.7.3 and above in standard repository, *GNU Radio* can be installed from packages without compilation. To avoid this quite lenghty process use:
```sh
./pybombs config forcebuild ' '
```

To check *GNU Radio* version use:
```sh
apt-cache policy gnuradio-dev
```

**Then build and install *gr-gsm* with following command**:
```
sudo ./pybombs install gr-gsm
```

Pybombs will take care of downloading all of required libraries and for installation of *GNU Radio* and building *gr-gsm*.

At the end create the `~/.gnuradio/config.conf` config file so gnuradio-companion can find custom blocks of gr-gsm:

```ini
[grc]
local_blocks_path=/usr/local/share/gnuradio/grc/blocks
```

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
CC=/usr/bin/llvm-gcc CXX=/usr/bin/llvm-g++ cmake -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/opt/local/bin/python2.7 -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Headers -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Python ..
make
```

Usage
=====
There are many possible applications of *gr-gsm*. At this moment there is one application that is ready out of the box. It is improved replacement of the old *Airprobe* - the program that lets you receive and decode GSM control messages from *timeslot 0* on the broadcasting channel of a BTS. After installation of *gr-gsm* there are two python executables that will be installed:

-```airprobe_rtlsdr.py```,

-```airprobe_file.py```.

Airprobe with RTL-SDR input
---------------
This program uses cheap RTL-SDR receivers as a source of the signal. It can be started by running from a terminal:
```
airprobe_rtlsdr.py
```
The window of the program contains amplitude spectrum of the signal drawn in real-time. The central frequency of the signal can be changed by moving *fc* slider. The GSM signal has bandwidth of around *200kHz*. By looking for constant hills on the spectrum of such width you can find a GSM broadcasting channel. After setting the *fc* slider to a carrier frequency of a broadcasting channel the program should immediately print content of subsequent messages on the standard output. 

If it doesn't happen, set *ppm* slider into different positions. The slider is responsible for setting devices clock offset correction. If the clock offset is too large the clock offset correction algorithm that is implemented in the program won't work. There is intentionally added upper of allowable clock offset - it was done in order to avoid adaptation of the algorithm to neighbour channels that would inevitably lead to instability. You can use the value set later by passing it as argument of the program:
```
airprobe_rtlsdr.py -p <correction>
```

Airprobe with file input
-------------
This program processes files containing complex data - interleaved float IQ samples.
Example of the usage:
```
airprobe_file.py --samp-rate=1M --fc=940M -i input_file 
```
where:
```
--samp-rate - sampling frequency of the data stored in the file,
--fc - central frequency of the recorded data - it is needed for frequency offset correction,
-i - the file containing the complex data.
```

Analyzing GSM messages in the Wireshark
-------------------------------------------
The *Airprobe* (file, rtlsdr) application sends GSM messages in *GSMTAP* format that was created by *Harald Welte* to the UDP port number 4729. Wireshark interprets packets coming on this port as GSM data with *GSMTAP* header and it is able to dissect messages.

On Debian like systems *Wireshark can be installed with:
```
sudo apt-get install wireshark
```
To start *Wireshark* straight to analysis of the *GSMTAP* packets obtained from *gr-gsm*'s airprobe use following command:
```
sudo wireshark -k -Y '!icmp && gsmtap' -i lo
````

This work is built upon the efforts made by many people to gather knowledge of GSM. 

First very significant effort of public research into GSM and its security vulnerabilities was The Hacker's Choice GSM SCANNER PROJECT. One of the results of this project was creation of a software GSM receiver by *Tvoid* - *gsm-tvoid* - which was  was the most important predecessor of *gr-gsm* and of *gsm-receiver* from the *Airprobe* project.

*Gr-gsm* wouldn't be also possible without help and inspiration by Harald Welte, Dieter Spaar and Sylvain Munaut.

Special thanks to Pawel Koszut who generously lent his USRP1 to the author of *gr-gsm* (Piotr Krysik) in 2007-2010.
